Fish Flock AI - Version 1.1.0

NOTE: Scripts will work perfectly on Mobile / PC / Consoles and while this scene was created with Unity 2017.1.0f3, it will work on all versions of Unity5+ by setting it up in the same way.

About
-----
The Demo scene gives you a good idea of what is possible with this fish flocking script. 

We have improved the script now to be more mobile and VR friendly. So if the player looks away from the fish, it will cease to function and consume resources, but
when the fish comes back into any camera (including editor FYI) it will commence functioning again. This makes for a dramatic increase in performance and is especially 
useful in VR games.

We have added a boolean option to each example shoal to set whether you want the shoal to move slowly from the startpoint to the destination.
We have also added a new shoal which sits flat near the surface to show that this script will work well in rivers and streams as well as deeper water.

We have set up a start and finish markers, currently setup as huge poles in the water so you can see where the fish start and hang around, and where the shoal is slowly moving towards.
Basically, this allows you to not only have a realistic effect of fish flocking behaviour and movement, but also a moving shoal that will hang around the bounds of a defined hidden cube area.

This way, the shoal can wander along an invisible path, while flocking as they go. Unlike many games where the fish flock is just static, this flock could travel around your scene.

Recommendations
---------------
The Fish Model is not game optimized, or animated. Both of which are recommended for a truly realistic Fish model and shoal using these scripts.
